> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Gitlab was new for me, i have been using github instead. I do work as Software test engineer and I'm quite busy in work at the moment so i couldn't use that much time as needed for these
tasks. Creating tests and executing them is mostly what i do and my goal is to learn how to automate test cycles.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I try to create test cases so simple that even a new person without knowledge to that app can execute them.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I do use Jira at my work so, that is the most familiar for me.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Everything i did or changed in text files has been done in visual code.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- 


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used github for learning myself and in some school tasks. I think developers in my team uses github too.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
-  Up next i'm trying to learn how to use robot framework with python. That's the one we have done automate test cases already. For me that's new but i definetly will learn it.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Robot framework, Jira came up first and these are the ones we use too. 



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I have a career already as i mentioned up there. So my main goal is to learn test automation with robot framework and python. Also I'm interested of learning basics of software developing.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- There was a lot of theory i haven't not faced before. It was interesting and whole course felt really good. I was happy to join this course even there was basics i already knew. Thank you for creating good course for all levels of knowledge.
